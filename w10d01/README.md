# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### Rails Week
* it was fun, JS feels more familiar
* if wanting an MVC, might as well use NextJS
* booleans and exclamation points; things seem more intuitive

### MVC
* Model -> represents the data (abstraction layer)
* View -> outputted HTML (UI); helper functions
* Controller -> brains of the operation

REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
